Colophon

---

I use the [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith) static site generator to manage all content on this site, and a simple bit of python to push it live.

I am tired of using bootstrap or insert new grid layout framework here, it kills my creativity. So I am just writing CSS and markup by hand, although I am using jade as well, for now.

Fonts are from Google Fonts, I really like [Cabin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin) and [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) which I am using along with the excellent [Tomorrow Night Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) for syntax highlighting of code.
